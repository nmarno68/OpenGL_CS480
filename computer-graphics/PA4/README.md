# PA4: Object Loading

# Dependencies, Building, and Running

Please save any .obj files to be loaded in src->objects.   
My board object is saved as "board.obj" and the dragon file as "dragon.obj"
To run please give the file name of the .obj file to be loaded as a command line argument.  

# Project Description
This project loads .obj files whose names are given as a command line argument and   
colors them randomly. The models also rotate on the x-axis in order to make them easier  
to see.
